White Chicken Chili Ingredients:

- Two large boneless skinless chicken breasts cooked and shredded
- 15 oz can of white northern beans
- 15 oz can of pinto beans
- 15 oz can of corn
- 8 oz of Verde salsa (the green salsa)
- 2 tsp of cumin
- 2 tsp of minced garlic 
- 1 package of dry ranch seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup of water (so it wouldnâ€™t be so thick)

Directions:
Throw it all in the crock-pot and give it a good stir and set it on low. Mine cooked for about 6 hours. If you are going to cook on the stove top, just throw it all in the pot and bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 -45 mins.
